# ADM-HW2

The script produced for this homework allowed us to answer the requests for an eploratory data analysis, some essential information, an historical view on the dataset, some questions about consistency, the influence of an author based on their fanbase, estimating probabilities and using charts, statistical tests and other analysis methods to check whether a hypothesis is correct.

### Data Collection and Analysis
We begin by processisng the two .json files (lighter authors and lighter books) then we proceed with a univariate analysis to get a better understanding of the types of data present as well as clean the unecessary parts. 
Later one we are able to dig deeper into the structure embedded in the dataframe in order to answer the question proposed.
The first question after the Exploratory Data Analysis is related to the books dataset and provides specific tasks that we needed to accomplish in order to get a view on the best and worst books for number of reviews and average score respectivly.<br/><br/>
In RQ3 we were required to build up a function able to give back: the number of books published, the total number of pages written, the most prolific month and the longest book written in a specific year.
In addition to that we asked ChatGPT to provides us a function for this task and then compared it to ours.<br/><br/>
RQ4 was about the consistency of the dataset so we needed to study the occurencies to improve our knowledge in regards of possible risks in analysing the data.<br/><br/>
The research questions 5 and 6 both had to do with influential authors.<br/><br/>
In RQ7 the study involves estimating probabilities.<br/><br/>
RQ8 required us to apply a linear regression to find out whether or not readers usuallyrate the longest books the worst and this question made us implement some statistical test in order to accept or reject some hypothesis.<br/><br/>
